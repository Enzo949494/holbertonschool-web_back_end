## 🎓 Conclusion

This project demonstrates modern JavaScript class syntax and OOP principles:
- Class declaration and instantiation
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Property getters and setters
- Static methods and metaprogramming
- Class abstraction and encapsulation
- Symbol properties and private class features

These concepts are fundamental for writing organized, maintainable object-oriented JavaScript code and understanding the evolution of OOP in JavaScript.
